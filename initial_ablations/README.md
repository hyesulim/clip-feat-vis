- `main.py`: Main module the feature visualization will be executed (modified from `demo.py` of original lucent library)
- `args.py`: Experimental arguments and hyperparameter for feature visualization algorithm. We recommend you to take some times to check individual argument for rich experiments.
- `utils.py`: Module of utility functions (to simplify the `main.py` and enhance its readability)
